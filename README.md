# NetReachabilityChecker

This is a very simple application designed to show you the status of a list of 
ip address or web addresses. This might be useful if your daily workflow depends on certain
websites being available. Multiple sites can be added, and their status' 
are displayed in the drop down menu. The status' of all added sites are checked 
using Apple's reachability api. When a site is found to be unreachable, 
a notification will pop up indicating this to be the case.
