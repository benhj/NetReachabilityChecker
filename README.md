# OSXWebsiteHealthChecker

This is a very simple application designed to show you the status of a list of 
websites. This might be useful if your daily workflow depends on certain
websites being available. Multiple sites can be added, and their status' 
are displayed in the drop down menu. The status' of all added sites are checked every
5 minutes. When a site is found to be unreachable, a notification will pop up
indicating this to be the case.
